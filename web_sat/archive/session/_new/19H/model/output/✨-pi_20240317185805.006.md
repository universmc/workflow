Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a possible outline for a brainstorming session on the topic "How to make the most of our time in the universe":

1. Introduction:
	* Briefly introduce the topic and explain why it's important to think about how we spend our time in the universe.
	* Explain that the goal of the brainstorming session is to come up with creative and innovative ideas for how to make the most of our time in the universe.
2. Warm-up activity:
	* Ask participants to take a few minutes to think about what they would do if they had a time machine and could go back in time to any point in their past.
	* Ask them to share their answers with the group and discuss any common themes or patterns that emerge.
3. Brainstorming ideas:
	* Ask participants to brainstorm ideas for how to make the most of our time in the universe. Encourage them to think creatively and come up with as many ideas as possible.
	* Some possible ideas to get them started could include:
		+ Using technology to enhance our experiences and make them more efficient
		+ Finding ways to slow down or speed up time to make the most of our time
		+ Using our time to help others or make a positive impact on the world
		+ Finding ways to make our time more enjoyable and fulfilling
		+ Using our time to learn new things and expand our knowledge and skills
4. Grouping and prioritization:
	* Once participants have generated a list of ideas, ask them to group the ideas into categories (e.g. technology, personal growth, helping others, etc.).
	* Ask participants to vote on the top ideas in each category and discuss why they chose those particular ideas.
5. Action planning:
	* Ask participants to come up with specific action steps for each of the top ideas.
	* Encourage them to think about what resources they would need, what potential obstacles they might face, and how they could measure the success of their actions.
6. Conclusion:
	* Summarize the key ideas and action steps that emerged from the brainstorming session.
	* Encourage participants to take the ideas and action steps back to their own lives and implement them in a way that works best for them.

This is just a rough outline, and you can adjust it to fit the needs and preferences of your group. The key is to create a structured process that allows participants to generate and develop their ideas in a creative and collaborative way.
