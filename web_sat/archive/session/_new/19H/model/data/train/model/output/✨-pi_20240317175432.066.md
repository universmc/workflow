Step 3 : Configuring the development environment using config.js file.

This step involves setting up the necessary variables, dependencies, and configurations for the project to run smoothly.

The config.js file should include the following:

* Database connection settings
* Server settings
* API keys
* Third-party service credentials
* Environment variables
* Security settings

Once the config.js file is set up, the development environment is ready for use.

Next step: Setting up the database schema and initial data.
