Sure, here is a possible implementation of the steps you've outlined:

Step 1-3 : DÃ©veloppement : ðŸ›°

* satellite.js : This file will contain the code for the satellite's onboard computer. It will include the logic for receiving and processing signals from the ground station, as well as the code for controlling the satellite's instruments and subsystems.
* ground_station.js : This file will contain the code for the ground station's computer. It will include the logic for transmitting signals to the satellite and receiving telemetry data from the satellite.
* orbit.js : This file will contain the code for calculating the satellite's orbit and determining its position and velocity. It will use the gravitational constant and the mass of the planet to calculate the satellite's orbit.
* signal.js : This file will contain the code for processing the signal received from the satellite. It will include the logic for demodulating the signal, checking for errors, and extracting the data from the signal.
* style.css : This file will contain the styles for the web interface. It will define the layout, colors, and fonts for the website.
* index.php : This file will contain the main web page for the satellite. It will include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the web page.
* request.php : This file will contain the code for handling requests from the web page. It will include the logic for connecting to the ground station, sending commands to the satellite, and receiving telemetry data from the satellite.
* scan.js : This file will contain the code for scanning the satellite's instruments and subsystems. It will include the logic for communicating with the satellite's onboard computer and retrieving data from the instruments and subsystems.
* srv.js : This file will contain the code for the server that will handle requests from the web page and communicate with the ground station. It will include the logic for connecting to the ground station, sending commands to the satellite, and receiving telemetry data from the satellite.

Step 2 - 1 : Configuration

* Configure the satellite's onboard computer to communicate with the ground station.
* Configure the ground station's computer to communicate with the satellite.
* Configure the web interface to communicate with the server.

Step 1-2 : DÃ©veloppement Timestamp unix ++ loading signal : [ðŸ“¡ - - - 3% ðŸ›° avant la connection.

* Develop a Unix timestamp that will be used to calculate the time delay between the satellite and the ground station.
* Develop a loading signal that will be used to indicate when the satellite is ready to receive commands.
* Develop a connection establishing procedure that will be used to establish a connection between the satellite and the ground station.

Step 1-3 : DÃ©veloppement : ðŸ›°

* Develop a program that will be used to control the satellite's instruments and subsystems.
* Develop a program that will be used to communicate with the ground station.
* Develop a program that will be used to process the signal received from the satellite.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
