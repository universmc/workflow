Step 1-4 : Développement : 📡: Ce symbole represents a satellite dish, which is used to receive and transmit signals from space. It is typically used in satellite communication systems, where it is used to receive signals from a satellite in orbit around the Earth and transmit them to a ground station or vice versa.

Step 2-1 : Configuration :

* ctrl.js : This file contains the control logic for the satellite system. It includes functions for setting up the satellite dish, connecting to the satellite, and transmitting and receiving signals.
* loop.js : This file contains a loop that runs continuously to check for incoming signals and send responses.
* sat.json : This file contains configuration data for the satellite system, including the satellite's ID, frequency, and other parameters.
* signal.js : This file contains functions for processing signals received from the satellite. It includes functions for demodulating, decoding, and error-correcting the signals.
* style.css : This file contains CSS styles for the satellite system's user interface.
* index.php : This file contains the main interface for the satellite system, including a login page and a dashboard for monitoring the system.
* request.php : This file handles requests from the user interface and passes them to the appropriate functions in the system.
* scan.js : This file contains functions for scanning for satellites in range and connecting to them.
* srv.js : This file contains functions for serving data to the user interface and handling requests from the user.

Step 3-1 : Développement : 🛰️: This emoji represents a satellite in orbit around the Earth. It is used to transmit and receive signals to and from the ground station.

Step 4-1 : Développement : 📡: This emoji represents a satellite dish, which is used to receive and transmit signals from space. It is typically used in satellite communication systems, where it is used to receive signals from a satellite in orbit around the Earth and transmit them to a ground station or vice versa.

Step 5-1 : Développement : 💻: This emoji represents a computer or a server, which is used to process and analyze the data received from the satellite. It is also used to send commands and data to the satellite.

Step 6-1 : Développement : 📊: This emoji represents a notebook or a document, which is used to record and analyze the data received from the satellite. It is also used to store the configuration data for the satellite system.

Step 7-1 : Développement : 🔒: This emoji represents a lock, which is used to secure the satellite system and prevent unauthorized access. It is also used to protect the data transmitted over the satellite link.

Step 8-1 : Développement : 🚀: This emoji represents a rocket, which is used to launch the satellite into space. It is also used to represent the excitement and thrill of space exploration.

Step 9-1 : Développement : 🌟: This emoji represents a star, which is used to represent the satellite system's connection to space. It is also used to indicate the system's ability to communicate with other satellites and ground stations.

Step 10-1 : Développement : 🌎: This emoji represents a globe, which is used to represent the satellite system's ability to communicate with other satellites and ground stations around the world. It is also used to indicate the system's ability to transmit and receive data globally.
